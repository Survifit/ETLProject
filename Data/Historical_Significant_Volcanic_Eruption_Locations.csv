<P>1937, May 28/29. There was an eruption of the Raluan and
Tawurwur Volcanoes in Blanche Bay. The eruption was accompanied at different stages by oscillations of the water level in the bay.<P>The first strong earthquake struck on May 28 at about 13:20. It lasted half a minute and reached a force of 7 degrees (VIII Rossi-Forel)... On May 29, at about 5:30, a new shock was felt at Rabaul... Between 8:00 and 9:00, an elevation of Kaluan Is was observed... 
<P>The eruption of the volcano began at 16:15 [May 29]. The island and the adjacent sections of bottom began to rise quickly; the little islands in the passage began to grow and merge, and soon a broad isthmus formed between the island and the mainland. Then the volcano exploded, and a black pillar of ash and steam 9 m wide and 12 m high rose into the air. The column grew with each subsequent explosion, and reached a height of 3 km. Masses of flames the size of a room or smaller flew up to a height of 1.5 km and then fell to the earth or into the water with A deafening noise. There were no lava flows.
<P>The eruption of the volcano lasted more than 24 hrs. According to rough estimates, it ejected 0.3 cubic km of material, which spread in the form of ash, mainly to the northwest of the volcano due to the prevailing southeast winds; 60,000,000 cubic m of fresh material was deposited immediately around the volcano under water and 190,000,000 cubic m was deposited above the water level. The height of the island increased from 9 to 200 m. Fields of pumice and ash 1/2 m thick floated in the bay.
<P>The eruption of the Tawurwur Volcano began on May 30, after 13:00. The eruption lasted until the morning of the following day; about 2,300,000 cubic m of material was ejected. It also settled to the northwest of the volcano, that is, in the region of Rabaul, where the layer of ash was several cm thick.
<P>During the first explosions of the Raluan Volcano, the underground shocks for the most part stopped. The water near Raluan Is was markedly agitated. At Rabaul, the water retreated 45 m several times, returned to the high high tide mark, and retreated again. Then the eruption was almost continuous for 3 hrs, but there were no noticeable oscillations in level.
<P>Beginning at 19:00, the eruption began to pulsate, and periods of explosions began to alternate with periods of relative calm. It was precisely, during such a period of calm and before 21:00, that is, before the lip of the new crater of the volcano had completely risen above the water, that considerable oscillations in level were observed in the harbor. Four to five minutes passed between the rise and fall of the water. The amplitude of at least three of these waves was 2-2 1/2 m above and below the mean water level. A schooner was run aground by the wave onto a small pier and then dragged to the depths of the bay together with the pier. Several boats ran aground, and one or two sank. Subsequently, the oscillations apparently diminished, but their range was still 1/2 m early in the morning on the 30th.
<P> During the eruption, <B>more than 500 people perished, including those who drowned</B>. At Rabaul, two homes and several small ships were destroyed in the rock and ash fall. After the earthquake and eruptions, a stretch of coast from Sulphur Creek to Matupi Island subsided, The

All 3,150 people in the path of these flows, on islands between Krakatau and Sumatra were killed; probably most by early tsunami but surely none survived the culminating eruption at 1000 on Aug 27.

<P>The renowned volcano Krakatau (frequently misstated as Krakatoa) lies in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra. Collapse of the ancestral Krakatau edifice, perhaps in 416 AD, formed a 7-km-wide caldera. Remnants of this ancestral volcano are preserved in Verlaten and Lang Islands; subsequently Rakata, Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes were formed, coalescing to create the pre-1883 Krakatau Island. Caldera collapse during the catastrophic 1883 eruption destroyed Danan and Perbuwatan volcanoes, and left only a remnant of Rakata volcano. This eruption, the 2nd largest in Indonesia during historical time, caused more than 36,000 fatalities, most as a result of devastating tsunamis that swept the adjacent coastlines of Sumatra and Java. Pyroclastic surges traveled 40 km across the Sunda Strait and reached the Sumatra coast. After a quiescence of less than a half century, the post-collapse cone of Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) was constructed within the 1883 caldera at a point between the former cones of Danan and Perbuwatan. Anak Krakatau has been the site of frequent eruptions since 1927.

These shocks occurred at an average of four per hour, and the vibrations continued into the following day. Thirty-nine shocks occurred during the night of September 9.

This was followed by an underwater eruption with its usual manifestations. On the 15th of September the eruption was repeated, and each hour approximately 50 eruptions occurred...During this time large pieces of lava floated up to the surface of the ocean, and tremors were felt on the islands. A column of thick smoke, rising to a height of about 600 m (2,000 ft), completely darkened the sky. 
<P>Although the eruption did not reveal open flames, gleams of fire could be observed on two or three occasions. The sea was extremely disturbed and for a distance of 20 km (10 miles) glittered with a phosphorescent light. Many dead fish floated to the surface and were cast upon the shore.

Huge streams of lava up to one cubic km in volume emerged, one of which moved in a northeasterly direction and reached the ocean shore, a distance 12 km from the crater on December 6, 1905. Fields and villages situated in the path of the lava stream were destroyed. From time to time the lava tongues fell into the water and gave rise to small tsunami-type waves (including at the end of 1906 and in 1907). One of the phases of the eruption was observed by the missionary, John Farlong. According to his account, after some periods marked by earth tremors, on August 4, 1908, two yawning fissures appeared from which clouds of steam, illuminated by flames and eruptive material, shot up with explosive force. The streams of lava moved at a rate of 900 m (1/2 mile) in a 24 hour period, and at the points where the lava fell into the sea huge columns of steam rose, several times in the same area. They were 450 m (500 yards) in length and inundated the land for a distance of 90-110 m (100-120 yards). According to observers, the appearance of the waves coincided with increasing volcanic activity. (reference #415)

The towns of Palmer, San Felipe, Coombia, and Centepee, are all ruined. Ashes are 7 ft. deep in the tineas and towns. Mud, stones, and lava have fallen all over the country. Houses have been crushed by the weight of the volcanic material that has fallen upon them. Retalhuleu, Mazatenango, and Quezaltenango have not suffered so much, but this calamity is only beginning. We have mud and ashes in Retalhuleu. There is great loss of life. Cattle and horses are dead by thousands. Famine and pest are approaching. God help us! Bridges and roads have been destroyed. It is impossible to get further news.
<P>LIVES REPORTED LOST.<br>It is the common belief in all the coast towns of Central America that thousands of lives have been sacrificed in this awful disaster. Those who have come in from the region immediate to the zone of devastation insist that all who were in the towns of Pilmar, San Felipe, Colombia, and Coatepee must have perished.
<P>LOSS REACHES MILLIONS.<br>The property losses are enormous. The estimates of these losses are in varying millions. The coffee fincas of the Western Department of Guatemala were among the most productive and profitable in the world. On October 31 advices were received in this city to the effect that the entire coffee zone of Guatemala had been destroyed, and that the lives of all engaged on the fincas and living in the towns and villages were in imminent danger. Later information not only confirms these first reports, but greatly enlarges the area of destruction and vastly increases the amount of loss to the coffee planters.
<P>AN OFFICIAL REPORT.<br>Mr. James C. McNally, United States Consul-General at Guatemala City, in his official report to the State Department, estimates the total loss at more than £1,000,000. He says ;  As a climax to the terrible earthquakes of April 18, which practically compassed the ruin of Quezaltenango, the volcano Santa Maria, almost adjoining that city, erupted on October 24, throwing out quantities of mud and ashes, causing untold damage on the coast side, which comprises the rich coffee zone of Guatemala. The volcano is still active, and ashes are falling on places 30 miles distant from the crater.
<P>FIFTEEN THOUSAND PERSONS DEAD.<BR>Mr. Hans Lang left here six weeks ago to assume the position of assistant manager of the plantation of Lucerno, near Osuna. In speaking of the loss of life resulting from the eruption, Mr. Lang said:--In Guatemala City it was estimated that 15,000 lives were lost. The exact number will never be known, as thousands lie buried beneath the ashes, and their bodies will never be recovered. I was stationed fifty miles from Santa Maria, and no ashes fell on my plantation, although the rumblings were distinctly heard and the lightning flashes plainly seen.

The ashes and water mixed with rubble inundated the southern coast of the island for a distance of 2 miles. The report that the sea was agitated six months later, and the lack of reports of waves at the time of the main eruption, casts doubt on this as a report of a tsunami. This account in Soloviev and Go (1975) that was taken from Perry (1865) forty years later is in error regarding the data. Veniaminov (1984, p. 18) reports:

At nearby Aliaksa and especially Morzhevskoi settlement, it was dark for 3 or 4 hours. On this occasion the ice and snow lying on the range melted and for several days flowed in a dreadful river, 5 to 10 verst wide [3.3 to 6.6 miles; a verst is 0.6624 miles].

<P>(Above from reference #239)
<P>Eruption certainty: Confirmed. VEI: 3. The beautifully symmetrical volcano of Shishaldin is the highest and one of the most active volcanoes of the Aleutian Islands. The 2857-m-high, glacier-covered volcano is the westernmost of three large stratovolcanoes along an E-W line in the eastern half of Unimak Island. A steady steam plume rises from its small summit crater. Constructed atop an older glacially dissected volcano, Shishaldin is Holocene in age and largely basaltic in composition. Remnants of an older ancestral volcano are exposed on the west and NE sides at 1500-1800 m elevation. Shishaldin contains over two dozen pyroclastic cones on its NW flank, which is blanketed by massive aa lava flows. Frequent explosive activity, primarily consisting of strombolian ash eruptions from the small summit crater, but sometimes producing lava flows, has been recorded since the 18th century (Reference #2432).

<P>October 6, 1883. A tsunami was triggered by the sudden displacement of a large volume of seawater from the impact of a debris avalanche at the north shore of St. Augustine Island.

<P>Between 6,000 and 9,000 people were evacuated (corrected from BGVN 17:03), and numerous houses and buildings collapsed under the weight of the accumulated ash.During the first three days of the eruption, government officials reported severe damage from ashfall over an area of about 186 km2, of which about 116 km2 are corn, cotton, sesame, beans, and other grain cultivation, and 70 km2 are sugar cane. In addition, numerous cattle were affected. The most severe damage extended from the volcano to the city of León. Primary damage to home, commercial, and industrial infrastructure, estimated at $3,000,000, was mostly caused by roof collapse on the first day of the eruption. As of 15 April, there were no reports of injuries directly related to the eruption. The 50 indirectly related injuries occurred predominantly during evacuations, and from falls as people cleaned their roofs; 1-2 people died from falls. The primary medical complaints were eye and respiratory problems. Refugees were evacuated to 4 centers distant from the most affected area.

Five climbers who ascended the volcano in the early morning hours of 30 April were killed by the explosion later that day. On 2 May the climbers were found a few hundred meters below the NE crater rim. Their corpses, recovered by Civil Protection authorities, exhibited 3rd-degree burns and severe injuries caused by contusions. Climbing the volcano has been officially prohibited since the current eruption began, and signs were posted at Paso de Cortes. During a helicopter flight on 3 May a depression was observed on the surface of the new dome near the SE inner wall of the main crater. Streaks of gravel and boulders running down the NE outer slopes of the volcano were 10-20-m wide and a few hundred meters long, and very close to the route of ascent taken by most climbers.

<P>A moderately violent phreatomagmatic explosive eruption of Taal Volcano, in the Philippines, occurred from 28 to 30 September 1965. The main phreatic explosions, which were
preceded by ejection of basaltic spatter, opened a new crater 1.5 kilometers long and 0.3 kilometer wide on the southwest side of Volcano Island in Lake Taal. The eruption covered an area of about 60 square kilometers with a blanket of ash more than 25 centimeters thick and killed approximately 190 persons. The clouds that formed during the explosive eruption rose to heights of 15 to 20 kilometers and deposited fine ash as far as 80 kilometers west of the vent. At the base of the main explosion column, flat, turbulent clouds spread radially, with hurricane velocity, transporting ash, mud, lapilli, and blocks. The horizontally moving, debris-laden clouds sandblasted trees, coated the blast side of trees and houses with mud, and deposited coarse ejecta with dune-type bedding in a zone roughly 4 kilometers in all directions from the explosion crater.

<P>Of the eruption in 1754, the greatest recorded in the history of Taal Volcano, we have likewise a description from the pen of worthy Fr. Buencuchillo, at the time
stationed at Taal, of which narrative the following is an abridgement:
<P>On May 15, 1754, at about 9 or 10 o'clock in the night, the volcano quite unexpectedly commenced to roar and emit, sky-high, formidable flames intermixed with glowing rocks which, falling back upon the island and rolling down the slopes of the mountain, created the impression of a large river of fire. During the following days there appeared in the lake a large quantity of pumice stone which had been
ejected by the volcano. Part of these ejecta had also reached the hamlet of Bayuyungan and completely
destroyed it. <P>The volcano continued thus until June 2, during the night of which the eruption reached such
proportions that the falling ejecta made the entire island appear to be on fire, and it was even feared that the catastrophe might involve the shores of the lake. From the said 2d of June until September 25, the volcano never ceased to eject fire and mud of such bad character that the best ink does not cause so black a stain. <P>During the night of September 25, the fire emitted was quite extraordinary and accompanied by terrifying rumblings. The strangest thing was, that within the black column of smoke issuing from the volcano ever since June 2, there frequently formed thunderstorms, and it happened that the huge tempest cloud would scarcely ever disappear during two months. <P>At daybreak of September 26 we found ourselves forced to abandon our dwelling for fear lest the roofs come down upon us under the weight of ashes and stones which had fallen upon them during that hapless night. In fact, some weaker buildings collapsed. The depth of the layer of ashes and stones exceeded two ""cuartas"" [45 centimeters or 18 inches], and the result was that there was neither tree nor
other plant which it did not ruin or crush, giving to the whole region an aspect as if a devastating conflagration had swept over it. After this the volcano calmed down considerably, though not sufficiently to offer any prospect of tranquility. <P><B>Twelve persons are known to have perished</B>-some carried away by the waves of the lake, others crushed beneath their collapsing houses. Thus the beautiful town of Taal remains a deserted wilderness and reduced to the utmost misery, while once it was one of the richest and most flourishing places. In the villages to the west of the lake, which were the greater and better part, all the houses have either collapsed under the load of material which had been piled upon them or have disappeared completely, swept away by the waves which in these places were so violent that they dug three ditches or channels, too wide and deed to be forded, and thus rendered impassable the road which joins the town with Balayan. In other parts of the lake shore have likewise opened many cracks and occurred very extensive slides. The worst of all is, that, the mouth of the river Pansipit having been blocked, the lake is rising and invading the towns of Lipa and Tanauan, both being on the lowest level, and inundating their buildings. All the animals of whatever kind have perished, some by being buried, others by drowning, the rest by starving, as not a green blade remained anywhere.

<P>This increase in volcanic activity coincided with the  first microseismic movements registered in Manila at 20h20m of the 27th. It appears that the explosions began to assume a terrific violence at 1 o'clock in the morning of the 30th. Shortly after 2 a.m. the volcano burst forth with frightful energy. A terrible roar which seemed to be at the same time subterraneous and in the air and could be heard in all directions from the volcano up to distances exceeding 500 km. At the same time there was seen an immense, threatening, black cloud, crossed by brilliant flashes of lightning and illumined by local explosions resembling globular lightning, the whole accompanied by peals of thunder for the space of half an hour. This tempestuous cloud must have risen to an enormous height, since it was observed from distances of some 400 km. 
<P>The chief feature of the eruption seems to have been a terrible explosion which with incredible violence hurled high up into the air and scattered in all directions glowing rocks, earth, mud, ashes, and gases. ..this death-dealing mixture mowed down or destroyed whatever it encountered in its path on the entire island and on the neighboring western shores of Lake Bombon. It cut down or uprooted trees and other plants, destroyed houses, and killed well-nigh every living being within a radius of 5 to 6 km to the east of the crater, and up to more than 15 km to the west thereof. 
<P>Of the 1,300 victims who perished in the 13 small barrios-some on Volcano Island itself, others on the western shore-many were killed in the act of fleeing; others were found buried underneath or among the debris of their huts which had been brought down upon them and torn to pieces, being partially covered with rocks and mud; some
seem to have been killed by instantaneous asphyxiation, as they were found on their mats in the attitude of peaceful sleep.
<P>An idea of the condition in which this region was left by the eruption is given by the report of Col. William C. Rivers, Philippines Constabulary. In this report, written February 5, it is estimated that the number of victims had then already reached 1,295. We quote from it the following passages: The worst stricken district comprises Volcano Island and west side of lake. All vegetation, including trees, destroyed. Country all covered with gray mud hardening under sun present-uniform ashen color. Mud flattened and covers all houses and objects.""
<P>After returning to Manila on the completion of his special mission, Colonel Rivers presented a final report in which the total number of dead is given as 1,335, that of the injured as 199. This report contains the further statement that 543 nipa houses have been destroyed and 702 head of cattle either drowned or otherwise lost owing to the eruption; the material losses, exclusive of ruined crops, are estimated at F130,159.<P>
The exact number of victims will probably never be known-first, because the waves have carried away many corpses and, no doubt, buried others beneath earth, trunks of
trees, and other debris, which filled up many depressions in the ground; secondly, because some have surely met their doom while fleeing toward the jungle, where their bones
remained more or less completely buried by the volcanic ashes. Moreover, the number of people who inhabited these regions is by no means known accurately, as they were in the
habit of passing from one village to another according to their convenience in attending to their crops.

<P>On Aug 11, 1749, began one of the most violent outbursts of Taal on record. It has been described by Fr. Buencuchillo, 0. S. A,, an eye-witness, since he was at the
time parish-priest of Sala. During the night of that day the top of the mountain burst out with tremendous force from the same crater which since ancient times used to emit fire and rocks. The course of events was this: <P>At about 11 o'clock of the night I had noticed a rather extensive glare over the top of the island; but entirely unaware of what this might portent, I paid no special attention to it and retired to rest. Around 3 o'clock in the morning of the 12th, I heard something like heavy artillery fire and began to count the reports, taking it for granted that they came from the ship which was expected to arrive from New Spain [Mexico] and which, according to an ancient custom, on entering Balayan Bay saluted Our Lady of Caysasay. I thought it strange, however, when I found that the number of detonations already exceeded one hundred, and still they did not cease. This caused me to rise with some anxiety as to what could be the matter; but my doubts were quickly dispelled, as at this moment there appeared four excited
natives who shouted: ""Father, let us leave this place! The volcano has burst out and all this noise and racket comes from it!"" <P>By this time it began to dawn, and we saw the immense column of smoke which rose from the summit of the island, while several smaller whiffs issued from other openings. I confess that the spectacle, far from frightening me, rather delighted my eyes, especially when I noticed that also from the water there arose enormous columns of sand and ashes, which ascended in the shape of pyramids to marvelous heights and then fell back into the lake like illuminated fountains.<P>...During my flight I saw a great many tall trees, such as coconut and betel-nut palms, either miserably fallen, or so deeply buried that their tops were within reach of my hands. I likewise saw
several houses which formerly, in accordance with Philippine custom, had their floors raised several yards above ground, but had sunk to such a degree that the same ladder which once served to ascend into them, was now used to descend to them. The most remarkable thing about this is that the natives tranquilly continue occupying them, though they find themselves buried alive. <P>It rained ashes in considerable quantity and that part of them which remained suspended in the air, formed a vast cloud which grew so dense as to cause real darkness during the hours of broad daylight.<P>Fr. Murillo states in his ""Geografia Historica, etc.,"" that he was at the time at the Sanctuary of Antipolo which lies 21 km almost due east from Manila. During the eruption he felt three or four earthquakes of such violence that the roof tiles of the tower were thrown to a distance of more than 10 meters. Of less intense shocks there were more than one hundred, and the earth trembled frequently during more than a year. There were likewise fierce thunderstorms during many days.

The aerosol has the effect of reducing solar heat reaching the surface of the planet, leading to global cooling. Strange atmospheric phenomena had been observed in Europe before the summer of 1816. In May 1815 the sunsets in England were exceptionally colorful, and by September the sky seemed to be on fire every evening. But the spectacular skies brought bad weather the following year, and the year 1816 is the worst on record in Europe, with the mean temperature about 3 deg C below average across the entire continent from Britain in the north to Tunisia in the south. In England the summer was miserable, with the mean temperature for June the lowest on record, or 12.9 deg C. In France it was so cold that the wine harvest was later than at any time since record keeping began--delayed until November in those districts where the grapes were not already frozen on the vine. In Germany crops failed, a situation exacerbated by the war with Napoleon, and famine and price inflation were widespread. Conditions in Germany became so intolerable that people in many districts rioted and set off in search of better living conditions, starting the great migration from northern Europe east to Russia and west to America. The severe weather in fact led to crop failure of all the major crops in Europe and doubling of the price of wheat from 1815 to 1817. When we consider than in the early part of the 19th century agriculture was the mainstay of society, it is clear that the climate change had a strong impact on the economy of the western world. <P><blockquote><i>Reference #2432:</blockquote></i><P>VEI 7, Tephra Volume: 1.6x 10<sup>11</sup> m<sup>3</sup>.

<P>In the first months of this year [1871], about February 16, earthquakes became very frequent; shortly after
the inhabitants of Mambajao and Catarman became convinced that the radiating center of the seismic disturbance was located in their little island, and not very far distant in the same mountain, whose fertile side, covered with verdure, had never been suspected of harboring a dangerous enemy... 
<P>On the 21st [Feb] at 4 oclock a. m. a violent earthquake shook the island, causing considerable
damage to the stone buildings. On the flank of the mountain the sight was dreadful. The rolling masses of stone were destroying trees and plantations, while the opening
of fissures caused a noise like that of a great storm. The inhabitants of the town were terrified and from this moment began to escape in their boats to the neighboring
coasts of Mindanao and Bohol in search of safety...
<P>During the months of March and April earthquakes succeeded one another with the same frequency and
were accompanied by effects identical with those just described... The inhabitants of the towns in the neighborhood of Mt. Catarman, with the exception of a few of the bolder spirits and some of the very poor, fled from their houses. Hence it is that when the eruption actually took place it found very few victims. 
<P>At last the shocks suddenly ceased. When day broke on April 30, at the foot of Mt. Catarman, which had been so shaken by the preceding earthquakes that it exposed its skeleton through the landslides and fissures, a column of thick vapor was seen rising up into the sky near the sea and about 400 yards distant from the town of Catarman. This column of vapor disappeared completely some hours afterwards. <P>At about 7 p. m. of the same day a tremendous explosion was heard in the direction of the above-mentioned spot, accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke, which came from the same place. Everything roundabout
was set on fire. At the same time a shower of stones, earth, and ashes was vomited forth from the recently made openings. The ashes rose to a considerable height, spreading out and reaching Cebu and other islands 110 miles away. Within a radius of 2 miles from the new crater the destruction caused by the shower of fire, stones, earth,
and ashes was almost complete; but fortunately there is no report of many human victims, evidently because the inhabitants of Catarman, which the destruction reached, had fled in due time to safer quarters. The eruption continued for six or seven days, after which the paroxysm died down, but the silent flowing of the semifluid lava continued,
building up a rough cone, which in two or three weeks' time
measured some eight feet in height...

During the eruptions a huge landslip occurred on Endong mountain The mass measured 150 m in length, 100 in breadth, and was about 3 m in thickness. The kampong at Lesabe, in the Menaloe country was completely engulfed and 117 people were buried alive. The full extent of the damage resulting it is impossible to estimate. A tidal wave, 15 m high, passed over the coast and wrought much havoc. The Government school at Tamaho has been demolished as has the Palace of Raja Toboekan at Emawira. The shocks were of from 4 to 5 min duration. The steamship Flamingo has been sent with assistance from Tomini and is dealing out rice allowances to the destitute native population. A warship is on its way to the scene of the disaster, as many reports are coming to hand of damage done in other small islands near at hand.

<P>1856, March 2, between 19:00 and 20:00 [local time]. On Sangihe Is, after a sudden ""unbearable"" roar, the Awu Volcano began to erupt. Incandescent lava rushed down the slopes of the mountain with irresistible force, destroying everything in its path. Where the lava reached the shore, the sea water began to boil. Strong hot springs gushed up and the abundant surging boiling water destroyed and carried away everything that the fire had spared. 
<P>The sea surged onto the shore cliffs as during an underwater earthquake, and with a terrifying noise, it flooded the coast and ""snatched its victims from the fire.""
<P>An hour later, thunderous blows were heard, shaking the earth. A black column of ash and stones was ejected from the peak of the mountain. The column rose to the ""heavens"" and fell in a rain of fire on the slopes of the volcano, which were lit up by the red hot lava. Total darkness
fell, in which one could not make out the closest objects; it was interrupted from time to time by outbreaks of light. Large bombs fell to the earth. The settlements and field s not destroyed by the lava were buried under a layer of ash and rocks. The flows rushed down from the mountain, and, encountering obstacles, spread out in lakes, which then became a new source of destruction.<P>All this took several hours. By midnight, all had quieted down, although the eruption began with new force the next noon. The ashfall continued all day and was so intensive that no light could penetrate, and almost total darkness set in.<P>A hurricane southeastern wind blew since the beginning of the eruption, and the ashes were carried as far as Mindanao Island. Later the wind blew from the north.<P>On March 17, there was a new eruption, in which fields and trees on the coast at Tabukan were destroyed. After this, the volcano quieted down, except that steam continuously rose from the numerous cracks and fractures. However, the lava flows were still so hot that one could not approach them. According to residents, the top of the volcano did not change noticeably in appearance.<P>At the main village of the island, Tahuna, several people were injured and homes were destroyed during the fall of ash and stones. Obstacles in the form of hills made the lava flow deviate from the village and turn to the sea in another place.<P>Along the flat slope between Tahuna and Kandhar, seven large lava flows descended to the sea, devastating this agricultural region. One of the flows passed through Kalongan village; only a few burned posts were left. Between Kalongan and Kandhar, a large area of the coast subsided below sea level. The mountain side had previously sloped gently to the very water line; after the eruption, it broke off as a steep wall about 60 m (200 feet) high.<P>The settlement of Kandhar, protected by this ""rib,"" suffered little: it was affected only by the fall of ashes and stones and the streams of hot water. In addition, before the eruption, the residents, fearing pirates, had hidden with their belongings in the thickets above the settlement, and did not suffer from the flooding.<P>The devastation was even greater on the coast from Kandhar to the northern tip of the island. Two tongues of lava thrust far into the sea to previous bottom marks of several metres (fathoms).<P>The number of victims was considerable: at Tahuna 722, at Kandhar 22, at Tabukan 2,039; total 2,806. For the most part, the people died in the gardens where they sought relief  from the heat. Those who attempted to run, were overtaken by flows of lava and water, perished under collapsing trees, were suffocated or were burned in the ashfall and the fires. At Kalongan and Tariang, the residents who took refuge in their houses died in the debris.

<P>09/1981 (SEAN 06:09) Lava dome destoyed; pyroclastic flows. No pyroclastic flows were observed during the growth of the lava dome first seen 31 January (although some sliding occurred), but it generated blasts of hot air felt by residents of a flank village. They were evacuated by the end of February, after VSI had issued a volcanic hazard warning. By July, the lava dome was 200 m high, its volume exceeded 8.5 x 106 m3, and its summit had become the highest point on the volcano at 875 m above sea level. Explosive activity resumed on 5 September between 2010 and 2105, producing a 1-km-high plume. This activity was followed by the destruction of the lava dome. Pyroclastic flows and nuées ardentes d'avalanche moved downslope, depositing 5-20 cm of tephra at one village, and starting fires at 36 structures, including a church and five shelters, at another. Because residents had previously been evacuated, there were no casualties. Since the destruction of the dome, the 3-component seismograph monitoring the volcano has recorded shallow earthquakes which VSI believes may be generated by sliding from remnants of the dome. <P>(above from reference #2432)",,1,Limited (<$1 million),,,,,,,,,,,1,Few (~1 to 50 houses),,1,Limited (<$1 million),,,,,,,,,,,1,Few (~1 to 50 houses),1,,0604-15=,Paluweh,Lesser Sunda Is,-8.32,121.708,875,Stratovolcano,Historical,D1,60415,Indonesia,0,,,398,1276

<P>1878, February, on the night of the 3rd-4th. There was a very strong earthquake along the coast of Blanche Bay, including at Rabaul. Soon after the earthquake, clouds of steam could be seen rising out of the water along the line joining the Raluan Volcano and the Tawurwur (Ghaie) Volcano. An hour later, the old crater of the Ghaie Volcano exploded with ""terrible force."" Flames and enormous masses of smoke and ashes were ejected. There were apparently <B>no lave flows</B>. A thick layer of ash and pumice covered the coast and Saint George's Channel. At Ghaie, a new cone was formed. A the site of the underwater eruption, a cone-shaped, but rather flat elevation 20 m high formed out of loose material. This later became Raluan (Baluan) Island. The eruption of the Raluan Volcano lasted three days, during which time total darkness reigned; fishes and turtles died. The eruption of the Ghaie Volcano lasted three weeks. Due to the prevailing northwest winds, the ejecta settled mainly in the sea, and on land only the regions immediately adjoining the volcanoes suffered. Blanche Bay and Saint George's Channel were plugged up with islands of floating pumice for a month.

<P>1871, March 3. On Tahulandang Island, from about the middle of February the residents of the island began to feel underground shocks. On March 2, chunks of stone began to roll down from the top of Ruang Volcano, standing in the sea 300 m from the island. On the 3rd at about 20:00 [local time], an earthquake began suddenly, and at the same time a thunderous rumble ""announced"" the eruption of the volcano. <P>A few seconds later, an enormous wave surged onto the coast of Tahulandang Island. It penetrated 180 m inland, and destroyed all the huts and plantations in its path. At the center of Tahulandang (Buhias) settlement, a wave rose 25 m above the usual sea level, as was determined by an official who investigated the island on March 30-31, from objects which caught on some trees which survived the waves. Two more waves followed the first wave at very short intervals.
<P>Of the fluorishing settlement, consisting of 75 homes, there remained only three huts on its northern margin. However, they were all heavily damaged, and only one remained suitable for habitation; in addition, all the outbuildings and utensils kept under the huts were washed off. All the other homes were overturned and smashed or washed away, including a well-built church with stone walls 0.5 m thick. Bits of masonry were scattered around for a distance of up to 100 m, so that only the remaining paved courtyard indicated the previous site of the church. The earth was furrowed with ditches, carved out by the retreating water. The trees were uprooted and strewn helter-skelter with debris of homes and various utensils. A small ship was tossed to the foot of the mountain. The plantations situated on the mountain side remained intact. Out of the 500 residents of the settlement, 277 died.
<P>Other settlements on the western and southwestern shore of the island also suffered destruction (Bohoi, Tulusan, Haasi). In all, about 400 people died on the island.
<P>All the plantations and in general all the vegetation on the slopes of the Ruang Volcano were also destroyed.

<P>The Javanese ""Book of kings"" (""Rustaka radja"" ) , which is a chronicle of the island , contains the following account of the eruption of Mount Kapi. In 338 Saka (that is, 416), a thunderous roar was heard from the bowels of Mount Ratuwara (also called Pulosari, an extinct volcano in the Banten region, the closest to the Sunda strait). This roar was answered by an identical roar from the bowels of Mount Kapi, which is situated west of the modern [region?] of Eanten. An enormous blinding flame, which reached the heavens, exploded from Kapi* Mountain. The whole world shook, Thunder pealed out, a storm burst, and it began to rain. However, the eruption of flame from Mount Kapi not only did not diminish with the rain , but even increased, The roar was terrifying. In the end, Mount Kapi exploded into pieces with a terrific noise and descended into the depths of the earth. A sea wave arose and inundated the land... After the water receded, Mount Kapi and its locality were left on the sea bottom, while Java Island split into two parts. Thus the islands of Sumatra and Java were separated. [The events are very similar to the famous eruption of Krakatau in 1883. It is possible that Mount Kapi is in fact the Krakatau Volcano.] 
<P><blockquote><i>Reference #2771:</blockquote></i>
<P>According to ancient Japanese scriptures, the first known supercolossal eruption of Krakatau occurred in the year 416 A. D. - Some have reported it to occur in 535 A.D. The energy of this eruption is estimated to have been about 400 megatons of TNT, or the equivalent of 20,000 Hiroshima bombs. This violent early eruption destroyed the volcano,
which collapsed and created a 7 km wide submarine caldera. The remnants of this earlier violent volcanic explosion were the three islands of Krakatau, Verlaten and Lang (Rakata, Panjang, and Sertung). Undoubtedly the 416 A.D. eruption/explosion/collapse generated a series of catastrophic tsunamis, which must have been much greater than those generated in 1883. The time of tsunami with wave height of several meters that affected Tamilnadu in
India matches with this early Krakatau eruption. However, there are no other records to document the size of these early tsunamis or the destruction they caused. Subsequent to the 416 A.D. eruption and prior to 1883, three volcanic cones of Krakatau and at least one older caldera had combined again to form the island of Rakata. 
<P><blockquote><i>Reference #2432:</blockquote></i>
<P>The renowned volcano Krakatau (frequently misstated as Krakatoa) lies in the Sunda Strait between Java and Sumatra. Collapse of the ancestral Krakatau edifice, perhaps in 416 AD, formed a 7-km-wide caldera.

years, i.e. eruptions were possibly fairly continuous in
the area since the events noted above under AD 200. (An eruption of Jabal Zabib, north of San'a, occurred
sometime during the third century AD). The source of the eruption was the southern foot of the cone of Kaulat Hattab; Al-Hamdani says that the origin of the fire was the extreme end of mount Darawan, a statement confirmed by field studies, which showed that lava flowed in a southern direction to the edge of the village of Darawan.

Inscriptions found here indicate that there was a large temple of the Moon God Ta'lab Ri'am, of which, however, no ruins were found, possibly buried under the lava flow. Ruins of the temple of the Sun Goddess Dhat Ba'dan suggest that the site was burnt down, probably by this eruption. This temple is located a few hundred metres southeast of al-Huqqa (Bait al-Haqr) which, according to an inscription, was still in use in AD 200. Thus, if the temple was burnt by this eruption, the activity must have taken place after that year. (reference #3845)

<P><blockquote><i>Reference #10691:</blockquote></i>
<P>From Grey (2003): ""A new crater is reported to have formed within the caldera in 1878 (Hantke, 1951), accompanied by earthquakes and a tsunami (location unknown). This could refer to the birth of Cone A, but since Hantke offers no additional information or references to support this notion, the report is apocryphal at best. It is intriguing to note that eruptions are also reported at Vsevidof, on the southwestern end of Umnak Island, in 1817, 1830, and 1878 (Miller et al., 1998). Of particular interest is the suggestion by Miller et al. that the 1878 activity of Vsevidof 'may have been from a radial fissure eruption on the west flank; this event may have produced the youngest dacite flow, which extends west-southwest to Cape Kigushimkada.' Such a fissure eruption would probably produce earthquakes and could account for Hantke's 'new crater,' though not located inside a caldera. <b>It is thus possible that Hantke misinterpreted the location of the 1878 activity, and there may not have been an eruption at Okmok in that year at all.</b>"" 
<P>Sapper (1917), compiling information from Petroff (1884) and Fuchs, reports ""a brief flame and ash eruption and a new crater developed from which came steam and hot cooking mud. This new crater appeared between Vsevidof and the settlement."" This statement seems to support Miller et al.'s (1998) assertion that <b>there was a radial fissure eruption at Vsevidof in 1878</b>.

<P>Confirmed eruption of Okmok in 1878. VEI: 2. The broad, basaltic Okmok shield volcano, which forms the NE end of Umnak Island, has a dramatically different profile than most other Aleutian volcanoes. The summit of the low, 35-km-wide volcano is cut by two overlapping 10-km-wide calderas formed during eruptions about 12,000 and 2050 years ago that produced dacitic pyroclastic flows that reached the coast. More than 60 tephra layers from Okmok have been found overlying the 12,000-year-old caldera-forming tephra layer. Numerous satellitic cones and lava domes dot the flanks of the volcano down to the coast, including 1253-m Mount Tulik on the SE flank, which is almost 200 m higher than the caldera rim. 
<P>Some of the post-caldera cones show evidence of wave-cut lake terraces; the more recent cones, some of which have been active historically, were formed after the caldera lake, once 150 m deep, disappeared. Hot springs and fumaroles are found within the caldera. Historical eruptions have occurred since 1805 from cinder cones within the caldera.

The 1991 eruption, one of the world's largest of the 20th century, ejected massive amounts of tephra and produced voluminous pyroclastic flows, forming a small, 2.5-km-wide summit caldera whose floor is now covered by a lake. Caldera formation lowered the height of the summit from 1745 to 1486 m. Although the eruption caused hundreds of fatalities and major damage with severe social and economic impact, successful monitoring efforts greatly reduced the number of fatalities. Widespread lahars that redistributed products of the 1991 eruption have continued to cause severe disruption.
<P>March 1991. The press reported that an explosion on 2 April deposited ash over an area of about 10,000 m2, including part of one village, and that about 2,000 people were evacuated. No injuries or deaths were reported. PHIVOLCS confirmed the explosion, and later noted a SW-NE-trending line of new vents extending 0.5-1.0 km on the N side of the volcano. The vents continued to emit a gas plume 200-500 m high as of mid-April. Observers at Clark Air Force Base (~15 km E) reported sulfurous odors. A seismic net, installed following the 2 April explosion, recorded increasing seismicity, reaching 135 earthquakes on 15 April.
<P>April 1991. On 2 April, an explosion at the E end of Pinatubo's geothermal area (about 1.5 km NW of the summit and 2/3 of the way down the flank) ejected clouds of steam and minor quantities of ash to 500-800 m height. Ash fell 2 km away, primarily to the NW and SW, and covered an area of about 10,000 m2, including part of one village, from which about 2,000 people were evacuated. No injuries or deaths were reported. 
<P>May-June 1991. After more than 2 months of increasing seismicity, deformation, and emission of small plumes, a series of strong explosions culminated in one of the largest eruptions of this century. The 15-16 June climactic phase lasted more than 15 hours, sending tephra to 30 km altitude, generating voluminous pyroclastic flows, and leaving a small caldera in the former summit region. Ten days later, the aerosol cloud formed a nearly continuous band that stretched 11,000 km from Indonesia to Central Africa. Timely evacuations saved many lives, but the combined effects of the eruption and a typhoon killed more than 300 people.

By early June [1991], officials called for the evacuation of 25,000 people living in the area, including American service people at Clark Air Base and the U.S. Naval Station at Subic Bay. By June 14 the recommended evacuation radius was 30 kilometers, which would have applied to perhaps 400,000 people, Newhall said. Never before had such a widespread evacuation attempt been made before a volcanic eruption. By the time the volcano erupted on 15 June, scientists and public officials had convinced more than 65,000 people to evacuate. More than 350 died during the eruption, but USGS and PHIVOLCS estimate that evacuation efforts saved between 5000 and 20,000 lives.

25.396,36.404,46,,,3,10204,,,Y,"46 AD July 6. Thera. At the same time as an eclipse of the Moon, probably following a subdued eruption, an islet, which became known as Theia, rose up from the sea between Thera and Therasia in the Cyclades.
<P>This event is well documented by contemporary authors, including Seneca, who confirms that it happened in his own time and during the consulship of Valerius Asiaticus (AD 46). Dio Cassius dates it Roman year 800 (AD 47), while St Jerome gives the fifth year of Olympiad CCVI (AD 45), and notes the length of the island as 30 stadia (5.5 km). Orosius (writing early in the fifth century AD) dates it to the fifth year of Claudius (AD 45-46).
<P>Since Aurelis Victor mentions that it happened on the same night as a lunar eclipse, there is a chance of dating the eruption accurately. Schove and Fletcher (1987, 9-11) derive several dates, noting that the most popular is 31 December AD 46, because this would embrace both Seneca's date of AD 46 and Dio's of AD 47. However, he thinks that 6 July AD 46 is more probable because the eclipse would have been distinctly noticeable by about 8.53 pm, and consequently more likely to be recorded.
<P>Modern cataloguers associated this eruption with the Crete earthquake of 62-64, dating it 53/52/66. Guidoboni (1989, 661-662), Guidoboni et al. (1994, 193-194) associate this eruption at Thera with the Crete earthquake of 62-64, dating it 53/52/66 for which I have no evidence.

Ditches were dug in an effort to control lava flows, but by the 29th they were completely covered by lava. Authorities also tried to control the flows by having planes douse the lava with water, causing the flows to cool and stagnate, but they continued to travel down the volcano's flanks. Authorities stressed that the popular ski town of Linguaglossa (6,000 residents), located ~15 km NE of Etna's summit, was not in danger of being engulfed by lava flows. As a precautionary measure ~50 residents were evacuated and schools were closed. By the 28th lava flows had destroyed several hotels, restaurants, a ski school, ski lift pylons, and power lines on the volcano's flanks. Ash fell in towns at the base of the volcano.

The most energetic phase of the eruption (1147 UTC on May 29) was brief, lasting about 10 minutes based on seismic records on adjacent Sarigan and Anatahan Islands, sending an ash and gas cloud perhaps as high as 40,000 ft above sea level. The eruption was preceded by two moderate earthquakes and many smaller shocks; a moderate earthquake of magnitude approximately 4.8 accompanied the eruption. The eruption cloud drifted to the south, eventually passing over Guam, but no fallout was reported on Guam or Saipan. Following the short-lived explosion, activity appears to have ceased.
<P>Evidence of submarine volcanic activity was first observed late on May 28 during aerial observations by a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) Emergency Management Office (EMO) technician who noted an elongate patch of discolored ocean water and possible light-colored floating debris about 5 miles south of Sarigan Island. AVO seismologists noted tremor on nearby seismic stations about the same time. On May 29, satellite image analysis by the National Weather Service in Guam indicated that the area of disturbance had grown significantly in size prior to the 1147 UTC explosion. Within hours of the eruption, seismic activity began to wane, and after May 31, only a few scattered seismic events continue to be recorded. 
<P>The exact location of the active vent is still uncertain. The most likely source is the general summit area of a conical volcanic seamount located about 7 miles south of Sarigan Island. 
<P>A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service research crew camped on Sarigan Island during the eruption reported many felt earthquakes prior to the eruption and an explosion like 'thunder' accompanying the event. They also heard increasing wave activity during the night that may have been associated with the eruption; subsequently, a minor ash fall occurred. The NOAA West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center reported a possible 2-inch high tsunami related to this event may have been recorded on a tide gauge in Saipan.

Crossing Unimak Pass on his ship with six other whalers, he observed an enormous mass of dense black smoke from a volcanic eruption on the adjacent islands. The ships were becalmed, leaving them exposed to the danger of the eruption. After twelve hours, a light breeze enabled the ships to begin moving away in the pitch blackness. Sailing west and north of the eastern shore they were near the northern base of the volcano when a prolonged dull rumble was heard and an underwater eruption began almost under the flotilla. The water churned and began to rise stormily in the form of disorganized waves. Then it rushed up, as if ejected from an enormous spring, forming a dazzling column of water of colossal height. A shaft of fire and smoke rose from the depths, with peals of thunder. Volcanic ejecta, the size of walnuts to cannon balls, landed on the ships. This phase ended quickly and water rushed into the abyss forming a colossal whirlpool. The ships escaped. The volcano was Mount Shihsaldin. As this is a report taken from American sources the date is Gregorian. None of the effects describe organized wave action, and this is probably not a tsunami report. Validity 1 (Reference #239).

Very strong activity from January 1994 to January 1995 (comparable to 1976-77) ejected bombs in a radius of ~400 m from the crater rim. Ashfall measured at the surveillance station totaled ~12 cm during January-October 1994. Seismicity remained high throughout 1994, then declined after January 1995.
Because Yasur is very accessible, it has been promoted as a tourist destination, resulting in a greater number of visitors and greater risk of accidents.

According to news articles an eruption from Fogo's Pico cone inside the Cha Caldera began in the morning on 23 November after increased activity detected in the previous weeks and felt earthquakes by residents the night before. The eruption started at a vent on the WSW base of Pico cone, near or at where explosions originated in 1995, and then rose from multiple vents. The activity was characterized by explosions, lava fountains, and ash emissions. About 700 people evacuated from Chã das Caldeiras and the local airport closed. During the afternoon on 24 November workers removed items from the national park headquarters and by the evening lava had overtaken the building. Lava flows had crossed a main road and taken down communication poles. The Toulouse VAAC noted that a cloud observed in satellite images composed mainly of sulfur dioxide drifted over 220 km NW at an altitude of 9.1 km (30,000 ft) a.s.l. Ash in the cloud was detected at lower altitudes. By 25 November the lava flow was 4 km long. (reference #2432)
<P>The eruption continues, but the situation is critical inside the Cha caldera.

<P>According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, an unexpected phreatic eruption at Ontakesan occurred at 1152 on 27 September after an 11-minute period of tremor and uplift detected just minutes beforehand. The eruption produced a pyroclastic flow that traveled more than 3 km down the S flank and an ash plume that rose 7-10 km and drifted E. Ashfall was extensive in the area and up to 50 cm thick near the craters. The Alert Level was raised to 3.
<P>Earthquakes near the summit had temporarily increased during 10-11 September, and low-frequency signals were detected on 14 September.
<P>News articles on 1 October noted that 47 people had died, most of them found at the summit area while others were at a slightly lower elevation. Almost 70 more people were injured. Survivors described falling ash and boulders, and being in total darkness for several minutes as they made their way down the flanks. The volcano is popular to climb and nearly 300 people were hiking on the mountain that day.
<P>Seismicity fluctuated but remained elevated during 28 September-1 October. Ash-and-gas plumes rose 300-400 m above the craters and drifted E and SE.

OVDAS-SERNAGEOMIN reported that an eruption from Calbuco began at 1804 on 22 April, prompting the Alert Level to be raised to Red (the highest level on a four-color scale) and causing a 20-km exclusion zone to be declared. The eruption was preceded by an hour-long period of volcano-tectonic events followed by long-period events; no increases in seismicity had been noted since 2009 when real-time seismic monitoring started. After a large seismic event detected at 1735, a 90 minute eruption generated a sub-Plinian, gray ash plume that rose 15 km above the main crater and drifted mainly ENE, although fine ash drifted N and NW. Column collapses occurred locally and radially, affecting the headwaters of major rivers. Residents within the exclusion zone, in Chamiza, Lago Chapo, and Correntoso sectors, and in the town of Puerto Montt, were ordered to evacuate. Several roads and bridges were impassable due to ashfall. A larger second event on 23 April began at 0100, lasted six hours, and also generated a sub-Plinian ash plume that rose higher than 15 km and drifted N, NE, and E. About 5,000 people had been evacuated and ONEMI warned people not to go within 200 m of drainages due to lahar hazards. News articles noted that international flights in and out of several major cities were delayed or canceled. <B>Some houses in areas near the volcano collapsed from the weight of the ash</B>. ONEMI noted on 27 April that 246 of 4,514 evacuees were in shelters; the number of displaced people had peaked at 6,514 during 24-26 April. (reference #11206)
<P>Last week's spectacular twin eruptions of the Calbuco volcano will cost southern Chile's Los Lagos region, a tourism and agriculture hub, up to $600 million, a local business leader said Monday. The region is struggling to clean up some 210 million cubic meters (7.4 billion cubic feet) of ash spewed by the volcano, which contaminated rivers, lakes and vast stretches of prairie. ""The Los Lagos regional economy had annual turnover of $2 billion. We estimate the eruption of Calbuco will cause losses of up to about 30 percent,"" he said. Los Lagos has more than a million head of cattle, around 30 percent of the total in Chile, and supplies about half the South American country's milk. Chile's salmon industry, the world's second-largest, is also facing losses. Los Lagos has the largest concentration of salmon farms in the country, but many had their water supplies contaminated by ash.The effect on the region's key tourism industry, which draws about 200,000 visitors a year, is less clear. ""The volcano could decrease the number of tourists coming for outdoors activities... but it could also increase the number of tourists who want to see an active volcano,"" said Jadue.

<P>Crater lake overflow causes flooding; no volcanic activity. The overflow of Maughan Lake, the crater lake at Parker volcano, followed heavy rains associated with a passing typhoon and caused flash flooding in NW-flank communities on 6 September. A team from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) was dispatched to determine whether the overflow was caused by volcanic activity. Although no volcanic alert was declared, PHIVOLCS recommended that the crater area should be considered off-limits because of instability of the crater walls. Fieldwork on 8-9 September revealed that the flood was channel-confined along the NW-flank Alah River, which drains the crater lake, from 1,000 m down to 540 m elevation (Barangay New Dumangas, T'boli, South Cotabato Province). Below this point it was transformed into a sheetwash. The floods killed more than 60 people, destroyed 300 homes and nine bridges, and displaced 50,000.
